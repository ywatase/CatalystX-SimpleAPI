NAME
    CatalystX::SimpleAPI

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
USAGE
    In your actions, all your API arguments will have already been placed in
    "$c->stash->{'api_params'}". Your API response will be placed in
    "$c->stash->{'api_response'}". The "api_response" hash should have the
    following structure.

        $c->stash->{'api_response'} => {
            processed => 0,      # true / false value indicating the request was processed.
        
            status => 'failed',  # 'success' or 'failed' indicating whether the request was processed successfully.
        
            data => {},          # hashref containing the results of the api action
        
            errors => {           # error messages in the form of field => 'message' in the case of an error
                        general => 'failed validation' # 'general' should always be present to describe the overall error
                        ingredient => 'Ingredient is invalid.', # per-parameter error messaging if appropriate.
            }
        }

    If you process your request, you should set "processed" to 1 even if the
    request was did not have a successful result. The "processed" value is
    used to indicate that the parameters were accepted and the action
    requested was attempted. The "status" value is used to indicate whether
    the requested action accomplished what was requested. The basic rule of
    thumb here is that "processed" should only be set to 0 if the action
    could not be started for some reason (such as auth failure or other
    exceptional condition.) Note that if "processed" is 0, "status" will
    ALWAYS be failed.

    In your subclass, you will need to call the
    "$self->prepare_api_request($c)" method to initialize the API request.
    This is usually done in the "auto" action or the root of the action
    chain. Note that authorization failure sets up the response, but does
    NOT send it to the browser. The example below uses the end action to do
    that. If you use "$self->return_api_data($c)" somewhere else, you will
    need to check the return value of "prepare_api_request" and ensure
    "return_api_data" is called yourself.

    Your basic SimpleAPI derived controller should look like this:

        sub auto : Private {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            # will return false if the api did not pass authorization.
            return $self->prepare_api_request($c);
        }

        sub end : Private {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        
            return $self->return_api_data($c);
        }
